# YAZIO Exploratory Sessions

The following repository is created on the basis of several exploratory testing sessions conducted on the mobile App YAZIO.

## YAZIO app
This application's basic usage is free of charge, however the full access to the application, including recipees and higher-level analyses is based on paid subscription. It is a weight/diet controlling app with several functions connected with fasting, food preparation, activities and calorie count.

Acting in accordance with the Exploratory Testing rules, each of the sessions took around 90 minutes, including test data creation and the post-testing report creation.
The Exploratory sessions were divided into:
+ downloading the app
+ non-subscription user registration
+ setting up the account
+ adding a meal/removing a meal
+ setting fasting priorities/changing fasting priorities
+ adding activity/removing activity
