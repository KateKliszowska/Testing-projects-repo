# YAZIO Exploratory Sessions

The following repository is created on the basis of several exploratory testing sessions conducted on the mobile App YAZIO.

## YAZIO app
This application's basic usage is free of charge, however the full access to the application, including recipees and higher-level analyses is based on paid subscription. Therefore, both the free-to-use functionalities and subscription-connected functionalities were tested.

 It is a weight/diet controlling app with several functions connected with fasting, food preparation, activities and calorie count.
